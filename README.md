# QuicheBot

### Introduction
#### This project is no longer updated in favor of a refactor [here](https://github.com/cruzb/Quiche-Bot-2/blob/main/README.md)

QuicheBot is a multifunctional bot for the VOIP and messaging client, Discord. It provides administrative, informative, and fun utilities. It is designed to be fairly easy to understand, modular, and extensible. This was developed as a way to interact with API endpoints, plan how to build a large project, learn javascript, and make something fun to use with friends. This is coded in Javascript with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and SQLite.

There are many other features in progress such as streaming local files, points system, admin automation, etc.
